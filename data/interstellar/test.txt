A middle-aged BUREAUCRAT smiles at him from the far side of a huge desk .
ADMINISTRATOR You &apos;re a hero , Mr. Cooper .
Let &apos;s just start off by saying that .
It &apos;s an incredible and ... unexpected honor to have you here with us .
Cooper smiles , uncomfortable .
ADMINISTRATOR ( CONT &apos;D ) None of us would be here without the efforts of you and the other crewmembers of the Endurance .
( smiles , unconvincingly ) So I don &apos;t want you to take this the wrong way .
But there are some questions I &apos;ve been told to ask .
The man looks petrified , like he &apos;s been instructed to grill George Washington on his expense reports .
COOPER Shoot .
149 .
ADMINISTRATOR The rangers who found you reported that you had released a sample of an alien life-form into the wild .
Which is , unfortunately , against regulations .
COOPER It was last of its kind .
Their planet was destroyed .
The administrator cues up a series of images on his computer .
ADMINISTRATOR The rangers attempted to isolate the life-form , but it had already spread out of control .
It seems to be thriving .
He shows Cooper a satellite image of north america .
A considerable portion of the frozen tundra is glowing .
Cooper begins laughing .
Which makes the administrator even less comfortable .
ADMINISTRATOR ( CONT &apos;D ) Can you tell me why you ... elected to release the life-form back on earth ?
Cooper is still laughing .
COOPER Because that was the plan .
ADMINISTRATOR Whose plan ?
COOPER ( SMILES ) I don &apos;t know .
The administrator tries to smile back .
Makes a few notes in his file .
Changes the subject .
ADMINISTRATOR My assistant tells me you &apos;ve applied for a position with the exploration fleet .
COOPER Feel like I should be pulling my weight .
150 .
ADMINISTRATOR That &apos;s admirable , Mr. Cooper .
The truth is , most of the fleet &apos;s personnel are automated .
There are a small number of crewed ships .
But there are great numbers of candidates .
Very well trained candidates .
COOPER I was hoping to enroll in a course .
Try to get myself up to speed on the new systems .
ADMINISTRATOR I don &apos;t want you to take this the wrong way , Mr. Cooper -- like I said , you &apos;re a hero .
But the truth is we have somewhat limited resources .
Cooper remembers this conversation .
He looks down .
COOPER No one &apos;s heard anything from Brand ?
ADMINISTRATOR I &apos;m sorry .
Officially , she &apos;s been listed as missing for over 200 years .
Mind you , I guess you turned up eventually , didn &apos;t you ?
COOPER Am I really going to hurt anybody by going to look for her ?
I just need a small ship .
I made a promise .
The bureaucrat looks down .
Is he really going to have to tell this guy the lay of the land ?
ADMINISTRATOR Listen .
Mr. Cooper .
You &apos;re a hero .
You &apos;re the oldest man in the human race .
Don &apos;t you want to take it easy ?
( off his look ) I hope you understand , we all you hold you in the highest possible regard .
( QUIET ) Which is why they &apos;re never going to let you go off by yourself in a spaceship .
I &apos;m sorry .
Cooper looks at his hands .
He &apos;s got a couple centuries on the bureaucrat in Earth years , but looks ten years younger .
He puts his hands in his pockets .
151 .
ADMINISTRATOR ( CONT &apos;D ) I &apos;ve got some good news , however .
( BIG SMILE ) We all know about your early life , Mr Cooper .
I wrote a paper on it when I was a boy .
And I think we found something you &apos;ll really enjoy .
EXT .
CORNFIELD , COOPER STATION -- DAY Corn blows in an artificial breeze .
A red tractor makes its way through the field , which curves gently up in the distance .
ADMINISTRATOR ( V.O. )
The machines do most of the work , of course , but we were able to get you a few acres .
You &apos;re going to be a farmer again .
After a moment , the tractor stops .
Cooper climbs down from the seat .
Looks at the front steering linkage , which is jammed with an errant tree branch .
He wipes his forehead and begins working the branch out of the machine .
He looks miserable .
A robot , a similar unit to Tars , walks over .
Offers Cooper a bottle of water .
Cooper accepts it .
EXT .
HANGAR BAY , COOPER STATION Cooper stands on an observation deck , high above the hangar floor .
Below him , bright young things in uniforms climb into sleek-looking spaceships and prepare to set out .
EXT .
BASEBALL DIAMOND , COOPER STATION Cooper sits in the stands , listening to the familiar crack of the bat as an intramural team from the university practices .
Cooper watches .
He looks bored .
The kid up to bat cracks a pop fly .
For a second , the catcher shuffles back and forth , trying to get himself into position .
But the ball never returns .
The catcher YELLS out a warning .
Above , the ball begins to slowly fall up , not down , toward the town center above .
After a second , the ball smashes through a skylight of a building high above them .
Cooper watches as the kid rounds the bases , laughing .
152 .
INT .
KITCHEN , FARMHOUSE , COOPER STATION -- DAY Cooper &apos;s robot sits at the kitchen table .
Cooper is fiddling around in the back of his head .
ROBOT Settings : general settings , security SETTINGS-- COOPER Curiosity .
New level setting .
100 percent .
ROBOT Confirmed .
Would you like to make any additional changes ?
COOPER Sense of humor .
New level setting .
100 percent .
Wait .
( THINKS ) 80 percent .
He begins putting the robot back together .
EXT .
FARMHOUSE , COOPER STATION -- TWILIGHT Cooper sits on his porch , joined by the same robot as before .
They watch as the space station rotates lazily out of alignment with the local star , casting the inside of the cylinder into shade , then darkness .
The shadow races past them .
Another day .
Another night .
EXT .
HANGAR , COOPER STATION A maintenance worker finishes looking over one of the sleek- looking spacecraft .
He packs up his tools and heads out .
After a moment , two figures pick their way across the hangar floor , sticking to the shadows .
As they reach the first ship in the line , we get a better look .
It &apos;s Cooper and his robot pal .
The robot is wearing a baseball cap and carrying a toolbox .
Cooper gestures to the robot , who sets down the toolbox with a click against the mirror-like floor .
Cooper shakes his head , annoyed , at the robot , and puts his finger to his lips .
The robot nods , bashful .
Cooper waves a small handheld computer near the skin of the ship until it lights up .
Then he punches in a few codes .
Nothing happens .
He punches in a few more .
153 .
Suddenly , the hatch opens with a HISS .
INT .
SHIP Cooper moves quickly to the cockpit of the ship .
Looks over the controls .
The robot straps himself in next to him .
Cooper looks up through the windows .
The inky black void of space beckons .
Cooper smiles and reaches for the controls .
COOPER Where do you want to go first ?
The robot thinks it over .
EXT .
HANGAR , COOPER STATION The technician walks back into the hangar .
He walks along the row of ships till he reaches the last one .
It &apos;s not there .
He looks out into the blackness of the void .
Sees a tiny glowing speck , getting smaller and smaller .
