INTERSTELLAR Written by Jonathan Nolan STORY BY Jonathan Nolan , Kip Thorne &amp; Lynda Obst MARCH 12 2008 SPACE .
But not the dark lonely corner of it we &apos;re used to .
This is a glittering inferno -- the center of a distant galaxy .
Suddenly , something TEARS past at incredible speed : a NEUTRON STAR .
It SMASHES headlong through everything it encounters ... planets , stars .
Can anything stop this juggernaut ?
Yes .
Something looms at the heart of the galaxy , hidden inside the blinding starlight , a dark flaw in the fabric of existence itself : a BLACK HOLE .
The neutron star is pulled into the black hole &apos;s swirl , spiraling closer and closer to destruction .
Finally , it contacts the hole &apos;s edge and EXPLODES .
The EXPLOSION is so powerful that it sends shock waves into the fabric of space-time itself .
We ride one of these waves , racing back out from the black hole .
Suddenly , a portion of the wave disappears down a crystal- like hole , emerging in a much darker region of the universe -- a backwater that , as the wave races past a giant red planet with a distinctive eye , we recognize as our own .
The wave , now just an infinitesimal ripple , finally reaches our blue planet .
It drops into our atmosphere over North America , toward the high desert east of the Cascades , and through the roof of a nondescript warehouse .
The wave tickles the atoms in the steel shell of a vacuum chamber , then dances a tiny jig with a laser beam reflected in a heavy piece of glass .
The wave shoots back out of the building and disappears in the fractal branches of a tumbleweed resting against a concrete tube that stretches for miles in the desert .
An SUV speeds past the tumbleweed and we follow it till it parks at another plain-looking building at the opposite end of the tube .
A MAN climbs out of the SUV .
INT .
CONTROL ROOM , WAREHOUSE -- DAY The man lets himself into a large room that looks like Mission Control .
He pours himself a cup of coffee .
It is the weekend and the place is empty .
No one has been there to see the displays flashing a distinctive shape -- a pulse followed by a series of echoes .
The man looks up at the screen , then DROPS his cup of coffee .
CUT TO : 2 .
INT .
LIGO OFFICES , CALTECH , PASADENA -- DAY The Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory headquarters at Caltech is a frenzy of activity .
POSTDOCS and RESEARCHERS huddle around monitors and printouts , arguing .
ANSEN , 60s , the director of LIGO , walks through the frenzy .
A postdoc hands him a printout : a pulse followed by echoes .
INT .
LIGO DIRECTOR &apos;S OFFICE , CALTECH -- DAY Ansen steps into the relative calm of a large , sunlit office , which overlooks a grassy stretch of Caltech &apos;s campus .
His ASSISTANT , 30s , is on the phone , on hold .
He looks up at Ansen as he enters .
ASSISTANT I &apos;m on hold with the INS .
( COVERS MICROPHONE ) Don &apos;t you think we should double check the triangulation before we CALL ANYBODY- ANSEN We have double checked it .
Someone finally picks up the line .
ASSISTANT Yes .
I &apos;m trying to reach- ( pause , listens ) No , I don &apos;t think you understand how serious this is .
( PAUSE ) Because if you did , we &apos;d be having this conversation in person .
He listens for a moment , then hangs up the phone , confused .
ANSEN What did they say ?
ASSISTANT They said we should look out the window .
Ansen steps to the window and looks out : In the courtyard below , coeds are scrambling to get out of the way as a military helicopter sets down in the middle of the quad and dozens of ARMED FEDERAL AGENTS converge on his building .

INT .
MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM , LIGO , CALTECH -- DAY Ansen sits , alone , on one side of a conference table .
The other side is filled with GOVERNMENT MEN -- NSA mostly , some DIA .
The door opens and his assistant steps in .
Armed guards pat him down , then shove him into a seat .
ANSEN Is that really necessary ?
One of the NSA agents leans forward .
NSA AGENT You &apos;ve been complaining for years that the government doesn &apos;t take your project seriously enough , Doctor .
( SMILES ) You can &apos;t have it both ways .
Ansen motions to his assistant , who turns on a projector .
On-screen , we see the familiar pulse and echoes .
ANSEN Yesterday morning , our facility in Hanford identified this signal : a neutron star colliding with a supermassive black hole .
We went through the last year &apos;s data and triangulated the source .
The pulse is translated into a crude animatic of a neutron star circling into the black hole .
NSA AGENT We know that , Doctor .
What we don &apos;t know is why , according to your numbers , this event took place right here in our own solar system .
Suddenly , the image overlays the sun , the earth , and the rest of our solar system around the black hole .
ANSEN It didn &apos;t .
Because if it had we &apos;d all be dead by now .
On-screen , Jupiter , then the Earth and the inner planets are consumed by the black hole .
Only the sun survives , pulled into orbit around its new master .
ANSEN ( CONT &apos;D ) Which leaves only one explanation : The signal traveled through a ( MORE ) 4 .
ANSEN ( CONT &apos;D ) wormhole .
A gateway to a distant corner of the universe .
The black hole is on the far side .
On-screen , the black hole system is removed to a distant corner , connected to ours by a tunnel through space-time .
A gravity wave from the collision travels through the tunnel .
NSA AGENT I &apos;ve read your book , Doctor .
You said that wormholes are impossible .
ANSEN There is nothing quite as satisfying as being proved utterly wrong .
( SMILES ) I said that a wormhole couldn &apos;t exist naturally .
Not for more than a few billionths of a second .
It would have to be ... stabilized .
NSA AGENT Stabilized by what ?
Ansen pauses , unsure .
His assistant steps in to his defense .
ASSISTANT We don &apos;t have any way to answer that question .
NSA AGENT ( IGNORES HIM ) You &apos;re not under peer review here , Doctor .
I don &apos;t care about your reputation .
I need to know how that thing got there .
Now .
Ansen finally speaks up .
ANSEN If you &apos;re worried about an invasion , I would start drafting the articles of surrender .
( SMILES ) Whoever they are , if they can build a wormhole , they could erase us in the blink of an eye .
Luckily , that also means we have nothing they could be interested in .
NSA AGENT Then why is it there ?
5 .
ANSEN I don &apos;t know .
Maybe it &apos;s an invitation .
A chance to commune with an advanced species .
The assistant , embarrassed , looks down .
The agent notices .
NSA AGENT You don &apos;t agree ?
ASSISTANT ( DELICATE ) No .
I don &apos;t think we can assume an alien intelligence built the wormhole .
( CHANGES TACK ) But the opportunity it represents is incredible .
We could explore parts of the universe we never dreamt of reaching in our lifetimes .
The agent exchanges a look with one of his colleagues , who steps out of the room .
ANSEN We need to get back to work .
I have a conference call with our European partners in fifteen minutes .
NSA AGENT We severed the connections to your European partners this morning .
ANSEN ( INDIGNANT ) You can &apos;t do that .
The Europeans put up some of the funding ... GOVERNMENT MAN We &apos;ll send them a check .
( STANDS ) Your project is now classified under the State Secrets Act .
He steps out the door , leaving the men alone .
The assistant , outraged , turns back to his boss .
ASSISTANT They can &apos;t keep this a secret .
You know that .
Sooner or later ...
The younger man looks down , embarrassed , as he notices that tears are rolling down the older man &apos;s cheeks .
6 .
ANSEN I don &apos;t care about that .
I &apos;ve spent my whole life being afraid we would wipe ourselves out before this moment arrived .
We &apos;ve made so many mistakes , I wasn &apos;t sure we &apos;d make it ...
The assitant realizes that the old man is weeping for joy .
Relief .
ANSEN ( CONT &apos;D ) But this will change everything .
Fifty years from now , nothing will be the same .
The older man looks at the simulation on the screen of the tiny link between our galaxy and another .
FADE TO BLACK EXT .
CORNFIELD , CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- DAY Corn .
As far as the eye can see .
SUPER TITLE : &quot; FIFTY YEARS LATER &quot; A large old diesel tour bus is parked by the side of a dirt road , smoke pouring out of its open hood .
A dozen MEN in BASEBALL UNIFORMS are standing around the front of the bus .
A battered PICKUP pulls up , and a MAN , 30s , gets out , leaving his two SONS in the car .
This is COOPER .
He joins the ballplayers staring at the lifeless diesel engine .
BALLPLAYER Seized up on us .
COOPER Long way to come by bus .
I thought you guys would have a plane .
BALLPLAYER We did .
Ran out of parts for it .
You know anything about diesels ?
COOPER A little .
Cooper steps to the engine compartment .
The ballplayer notices Cooper &apos;s two boys , TOM , 15 , and MURPH , 10 , watching them .
He wanders over .
7 .
BALLPLAYER You think your dad &apos;s going to be able to help us out ?
Murph , a filth-encrusted kid with a black eye , smiles at the ballplayer .
MURPH My dad can fix anything .
( WRY SMILE ) Except maybe your fastball .
The ballplayer frowns : smartass kid .
After a moment under the hood , Cooper signals to the driver , who tries the engine .
